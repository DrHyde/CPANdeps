  <h1>A Brief Note on Statistics</h1>
  <p>The "chance of all tests passing" at the bottom of each set of results
    doesn't really mean much. That's because it is calculated assuming that
    passes (and failures too, I suppose) are what a statistician would call
    "independent events".  That is to say, if a particular test result is
    X, this gives you no information about any other test results.
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately this is not the case.  Failures "cluster" on particular
    machines because they've been set up in peculiar ways, or because of
    faults such as running out of memory or disk space.
  </p>
  <p>I could take account of that in my calculations, but:
  <ul><li>it would take a long time to calculate;
      <li>it would require writing some vaguely hairy code;
      <li>I can't be arsed
  </ul>
    If you feel that this is a particularly important metric, then you
    know what the solution is.  The clicky-link at the top of the page
    is what you want.
