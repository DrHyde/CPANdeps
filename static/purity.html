  <h1>A Brief Note on Purity warnings</h1>
  <p>Some modules, as well as depending on other perl modules, also have
    non-perl components.  To build these modules you normally need a
    working compiler.  
  </p>
  <p>I detect these modules by looking both at their dependencies and their
    MANIFEST file (which should contain a list of all files in a distribution,
    such as <a href=http://search.cpan.org/src/TIMB/DBI-1.607/MANIFEST>here</a>).
    If a distribution depends on any of the
    <a href=http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Inline&mode=all>Inline</a>
    modules, or if it contains any files with any of the following extensions,
    then it is assuming to not be "pure perl".
    <ul><li>swg<li>xs<li>c<li>h<li>i</ul>
    However if the string "PurePerl" appears anywhere in the MANIFEST, then
    I assume that there is a "pure perl" version *as well as* any "impure"
    version of the code, bundled up in the same distribution.
  </p>
  <p>This is, of course, only a heuristic.  You can't accurately determine
    a file's content from it's filename.  Possible errors from this heuristic
    include:
    <ul>
      <li>the "pure" version has some other name - eg, Params::ValidatePP
        (but looking for the PP suffix will just lead to other errors, with
	modules like PDL::PP or Inline::CPP)
      <li>a .c file might, for example, be used to test a module.  An
        example of this is Text::CPP (where PP stands for pre-processor,
	not pure-perl; although in this case, the module isn't "pure" anyway)
      <li>A perl file might contain C (or some other language) source in
        a string, and build and run it in some crazy non-XS, non-Inline
	way
    </ul>
  </p>
