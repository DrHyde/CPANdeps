<h1>Thanks to ...</h1>
<p>I wouldn't have been able to provide this service if it wasn't for the
  hard work of lots of other people who have generously let me use their
  software for free:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>for CGI.pm
    <dd>Lincoln Stein
  <dt>for DBI
    <dd>Tim Bunce
  <dt>for DBD::SQLite
    <dd>Matt Sergeant
  <dt>for YAML
    <dd>Ingy d&ouml;t Net
  <dt>for CPAN.pm
    <dd>Andreas K&ouml;nig (CPAN.pm was used in an earlier version of the site
      but has been replaced by ...)
  <dt>for Parse::CPAN::Packages
    <dd>Leon Brocard
  <dt>for Template Toolkit
    <dd>Andy Wardley
  <dt>for LWP
    <dd>Gisle Aas
  <dt>for Module::CoreList
    <dd>Rafa&euml;l Garcia-Suarez
</dl>

<p>And then there's these people who give their time to the community by
  running useful services:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>for <a href=http://search.cpan.org/>search.cpan.org</a>
    <dd>Graham Barr and the mirror sites
  <dt>for compiling the CPAN-testers database
    <dd>Barbie
  <dt>for testing all the modules
    <dd>the CPAN-testers
</dl>

<p>The site runs on Linux and Apache.</p>
