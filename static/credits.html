<h1>Thanks to ...</h1>
<p>I wouldn't have been able to provide this service if it wasn't for the
  hard work of lots of other people who have generously let me use their
  software for free:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>for patches to the software that runs this site:
    <dd>Shlomi Fish
  <dt>for the many modules on the CPAN that this site uses, or has used
      in the past:
    <dd>Lincoln Stein, Tim Bunce, Matt Sergeant, Ingy d&ouml;t Net,
        Andreas K&ouml;nig, Leon Brocard, Andy Wardley, Gisle Aas,
	Rafa&euml;l Garcia-Suarez
</dl>

<p>And then there's these people who give their time to the community by
  running useful services:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>for <a href=http://search.cpan.org/>search.cpan.org</a>
    <dd>Graham Barr
  <dt>for compiling the CPAN-testers database
    <dd>Barbie
  <dt>for testing all the modules
    <dd>the CPAN-testers
</dl>

<p>The site runs on Linux and Apache.</p>
