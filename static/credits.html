<h1>Thanks to ...</h1>
<p>I wouldn't have been able to provide this service if it wasn't for the
  hard work of lots of other people who have generously let me use their
  software or have donated their time for free:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The authors of <a href=http://www.debian.org/>Linux</a>, <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/>Apache</a>, <a href=http://www.mysql.com/>MySQL</a>, and <a href=http://www.perl.org/>Perl</a>;
  <li>Shlomi Fish provided some patches to the software that runs this site;
  <li>Lincoln Stein, Tim Bunce, Matt Sergeant, Ingy d&ouml;t Net, 
        Andreas K&ouml;nig, Leon Brocard, Andy Wardley, Gisle Aas,
	and Rafa&euml;l Garcia-Suarez
  wrote the many modules on the CPAN that this site uses, or has used
      in the past;
</ul>

<p>The design is by <a href="http://www.scriptedpixels.co.uk/">Kam Banwait</a>, 
  design time donated by <a href="http://www.foxtons.co.uk/">Foxtons</a>.</p>

<p>And then there's these people who give their time to the community by
  running useful services:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Graham Barr runs <a href=http://search.cpan.org/>search.cpan.org</a>;
<li>Barbie compiles the CPAN-testers database;
<li>The CPAN-testers provide all the test results
</ul>
