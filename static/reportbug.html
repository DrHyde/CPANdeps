<h1>Report a bug</h1>

<p><strong>If you</strong> think you have found a bug in this website,
please report it
<a href=mailto:david@cantrell.org.uk?Subject=cpandeps+bug+report>by email</a>.  Do not use that link to report problems with anything else.  If you do, you may be "named and shamed" here.  I get very annoyed at people who are too fucking stupid to understand basic instructions.
