<h1>Report a bug</h1>

<p><strong>If you</strong> think you have found a bug in this website,
please report it
<a href=mailto:david@cantrell.org.uk?Subject=cpandeps+bug+report>by email</a>.  Do not use that link to report problems with anything else.  In particular I <strong>can not help you</strong> with figuring out how to use a module, how to install it, or why it doesn't work, unless it's <a href=https://metacpan.org/author/DCANTRELL>one I wrote</a>.
